This repository is to analize the statistics of many casino games
Blackjack and Baccarat are the only two I have really been able to 
completely analyze. I have included three different methods of playing
blackjack to the user. They can either play themselves, have a basic
strategy player play for them, or a card counter. I have implemented
an ez baccarat which I thought may have some player advantage, but
I was unable to find. I plan on using some ML or AI for further
analysis of these games and others I implement.
